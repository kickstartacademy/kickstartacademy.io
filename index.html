<p>Are you struggling to get the most out of your agile team? Do you have a brand new crew who are just getting up to speed? Or do you simply want to learn more about BDD?</p>

<p>After training hundreds of people at the BBC in Behaviour Driven Development principles, and seeing huge success, for the first time <strong>Matt Wynne</strong> (author of <a href='http://pragprog.com/book/hwcuc/the-cucumber-book'>The Cucumber Book</a>) and <strong>Chris Parsons</strong> (well regarded speaker and trainer) are opening up their Ruby and Cucumber training courses to the wider public.</p>

<p>Come and equip your team to <em>really</em> succeed with BDD, without just paying lip-service to the ideas. We'll take developers and product owners through several days of intense hands-on workshops, and teach them to avoid the misunderstanding and gotchas teams so often fall into.</p>

<h2>Course schedule</h2>

<h3> Day 0: Just enough Ruby</h3>

<p>A ruby course specifically designed for programmers from other languages, to teach you the basics. If you've not done much Ruby before, then this day is for you. we'll get you up to speed fast on the basics that you'll need to know to comfortably use Cucumber effectively.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything is an object</li>
  <li>Data types and structures</li>

</ul>

<h3> Day 1: BDD</h3>

<p>Matt's blurb</p>

<h3> Day 2: BDD with Cucumber</h3>

<p>By the end of the day, you'll know what Cucumber is (and isn't), how to set it up and how it's best used. We'll take you through the different levels of behaviour in any application and how to properly capture your team's conversation in your features.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The lie of the land: the simplest possible cucumber project</li>
  <li>Adding features: the basic BDD cycle</li>
