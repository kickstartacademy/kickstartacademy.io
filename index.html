<p>Are you struggling to get the most out of your agile team? Do you have a brand new crew who are just getting up to speed? Or do you simply want to learn more about BDD?</p>

<p>For the first time, <strong>Matt Wynne</strong> (author of <a href='http://pragprog.com/book/hwcuc/the-cucumber-book'>The Cucumber Book</a>) and <strong>Chris Parsons</strong> (highly regarded speaker and trainer) are opening up their wildly successful BBC Ruby and Cucumber training courses to the public.

<h3> Day 0: Good enough Ruby</h3>

<p>A ruby course specifically designed for programmers from other languages, we'll get you up to speed fast on the basics that you'll need to know to comfortably use Cucumber effectively.</p>

<h3> Day 1: BDD</h3>

<p>Matt's blurb</p>

<h3> Day 2: BDD with Cucumber</h3>

<p>By the end of the day, you'll know what Cucumber is (and isn't), how to set it up and how it's best used. We'll take you through the different levels of behaviour in any application and how to properly capture your team's conversation in your features.</p>

<h3>Day 3: Advanced BDD</h3>

<p>Matt's blurb</p>
