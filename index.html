<p>After the huge success of their in-house Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) training, <strong>Matt Wynne</strong> (author of <a href='http://pragprog.com/book/hwcuc/the-cucumber-book'>The Cucumber Book</a>) and <strong>Chris Parsons</strong> (well regarded speaker and trainer) are opening up their training to the wider public.</p>

<h2><strong><a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/event/3754836818">See available tickets</a></strong></h2><br/>

<p>Come and equip your team to <em>really</em> succeed with BDD, without just paying lip-service to the ideas. We'll take developers and product owners through several days of intense hands-on workshops, and teach them to avoid the misunderstanding and gotchas teams so often fall into.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the course, <a href='mailto:hello@bddkickstart.com'><strong>get in touch with us</strong></a>.</p>

<h2 id='who'>Is this for me?</h2>

<p>
  If you'd like to get an overview of what BDD is all about, and some practical steps for making it work within your team or organisation, join us for <a href='#fundamentals'>BDD Fundamentals</a>, a single day of workshops, talks and group excercises to instill the core values, principles and practices that make BDD work.
</p>

<p>
  If you're more interested in learning to use Cucumber, SpecFlow or any other BDD tool to automate your application, join us for <a href='#hands-on'>Hands-on BDD</a>, two days of practical training with the technical tools required to make your application sing and dance.
</p>

<p>
  For a complete grounding in BDD to leave you with everything you'll need to succeed, we recommend the <a href='#full-package'>Full package</a>.

<h3 id='fundamentals'>BDD Fundamentals</h3>

<p>This dayʼs workshop is aimed at the whole team: Product Owners, Business Analysts,
Project Managers, Testers, Developers, User Experience specialists and everyone inbetween. The aim is to build awareness of and enthusiasm for BDD, with a chance to practice the core collaboration tools that make BDD work.</p>

<p>Topics covered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is BDD?</li>
  <li>How does BDD fit with agile?</li>
  <li>Specification with examples</li>
  <li>The importance of a ubiquitous language</li>
  <li>The three amigos</li>
  <li>Cucumber demo</li>
  <li>Gherkin syntax</li>
  <li>Writing readable Cucumber features</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='#hands-on'>Hands-On BDD with Cucumber, SpecFlow and friends</h3>

<p>By the end of these two days of very practical workshops, you'll know what Cucumber is (and isn't), how to set it up and how it's best used. We'll take you through the different levels of behaviour in any application and how to properly capture your team's conversation in your features.</p>

<p>BDD can sound easy in the safe environment of a training room, but what about when you get back to the real world? We'll prepare you for some of the heartaches we've seen people endure as they learn to love BDD.</p>

<p>Topics covered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The lie of the land: the simplest possible cucumber project</li>
  <li>Adding features: the basic BDD cycle</li>
  <li>Writing features right: layers of abstraction</li>
  <li>Refactoring existing features: tools and tips</li>
  <li>How to identify and resolve flickering scenarios</li>
  <li>Learning from brittle scenarios</li>
  <li>What slow test suites are telling you</li>
  <li>What to do when your customer won't read your features</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='#full-package'>Complete BDD Kickstart</h3>

<p>
  Book yourself on the complete three-day package to ensure you have all the knowledge you need to make your BDD adoption a success from day one.
</p>

<h2>Pricing and Location</h2>

<p>Pricing will be <strong>£450 + VAT per day</strong>. You only need come to the days you are interested in: there are discounts if you book multiple days. See <a href='http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/event/3754836818'>the booking page</a> for more information.</p>
