        <p>Imagine a software team where everyone understood exactly what they need to do.</p>
        <p>Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is revolutionising software development by turning traditional processes on their head. Instead of waiting until the code has been written to start testing it, we bring testers into the heart of the process, collaborating with product owners and developers to create specifications that make sense to everyone on the team. Developers then automate these specifications using Cucumber, ensuring the behaviour is automatically checked in every release.</p>

      <p>BDD deals with the trickiest part of working in a team: communication between people. Cucumber captures communicated requirements in a form that ensures your application stays working over time.</p>

      <p>Learn BDD and Cucumber in a hands-on practical workshop from two of the world’s leading practitioners.</p>
