<p>After training hundreds of people at the BBC in Behaviour Driven Development principles, and seeing huge success, for the first time <strong>Matt Wynne</strong> (author of <a href='http://pragprog.com/book/hwcuc/the-cucumber-book'>The Cucumber Book</a>) and <strong>Chris Parsons</strong> (well regarded speaker and trainer) are opening up their Ruby and Cucumber training courses to the wider public.</p>

<h2><strong><a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/event/3754836818">See available tickets</a></strong></h2><br/>

<p>Come and equip your team to <em>really</em> succeed with BDD, without just paying lip-service to the ideas. We'll take developers and product owners through several days of intense hands-on workshops, and teach them to avoid the misunderstanding and gotchas teams so often fall into.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the course, <a href='mailto:hello@bddkickstart.com'><strong>get in touch with us</strong></a>.</p>


<h2 id='who'>Is this for me?</h2>

<p>If you're a <strong>keen developer but not necessily very experienced in Ruby</strong>, you should consider the <a href="http://bdd.eventbrite.co.uk">full four day course</a>. We'll take you through the basics of Ruby, the reasons behind doing development this way, how to use Cucumber properly (saving you time in the long run) and some neat advanced tricks.</p>

<p>if you're a <strong>developer with Ruby experience</strong>, you might want to skip the first day and come along to <a href='#' onclick="$.scrollTo('#day2', 'fast'); return false">day 2</a>, <a href='#' onclick="$.scrollTo('#day3', 'fast'); return false">day 3</a> or <a href='#' onclick="$.scrollTo('#day4', 'fast'); return false">day 4</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a <strong>Product Owner, Business Analyst, Project Manager or UX specialist</strong>, come along to just <a href='#' onclick="$.scrollTo('#day2', 'fast'); return false">day 2</a> and understand why BDD is designed for you guys in the first place!</p>

<h3 id='day1'>Day 1: Just enough Ruby</h3>

<p>A ruby course specifically designed for programmers from other languages, to teach you the basics. If you've not done much Ruby before, then this day is for you. We'll get you up to speed fast on the basics that you'll need to know to comfortably use Cucumber effectively.</p>

<p>Topics covered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything is an object</li>
  <li>Data types and structures</li>
  <li>Flow, blocks and closurs</li>
  <li>Baking your own: classes and modules</li>
</ul>

<p>The day is very hands on, and you'll also receive an introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD).</p>

<h3 id='day2'>Day 2: BDD for the whole team</h3>

<p>This dayʼs workshop is aimed at the whole team: Product Owners, Business Analysts,
Project Managers, Testers, Developers, User Experience specialists and everyone inbetween. The aim is to build awareness of and enthusiasm for BDD, with a chance to practice the core collaboration tools that make BDD work.</p>

<p>Topics covered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is BDD?</li>
  <li>How does BDD fit with agile?</li>
  <li>Specification with examples</li>

  <li>The three amigos</li>
  <li>Cucumber demo</li>
  <li>Gherkin syntax</li>
  <li>Writing readable Cucumber features</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='day3'>Day 3: BDD with Cucumber</h3>

<p>By the end of the day, you'll know what Cucumber is (and isn't), how to set it up and how it's best used. We'll take you through the different levels of behaviour in any application and how to properly capture your team's conversation in your features.</p>

<p>Topics covered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The lie of the land: the simplest possible cucumber project</li>
  <li>Adding features: the basic BDD cycle</li>
  <li>Writing features right: layers of abstraction</li>
  <li>Refactoring existing features: tools and tips</li>
</ul>

<p>The day is full of practical hands-on exercises and group working.</p>

<h3 id='day4'>Day 4: Advanced BDD</h3>

<p>BDD can sound easy in the safe environment of a training room, but what about when you get back to the real world? This day will prepare you for some of the heartaches we've seen people endure as they learn to love BDD.</p>

<p>Topics covered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to identify and resolve flickering scenarios</li>
  <li>Learning from brittle scenarios</li>
  <li>What slow test suites are telling you</li>
  <li>What to do when your customer won't read your features</li>
</ul>
