        <h1>What is CD Kickstart?</h1>
        <p>
          In two days, we'll teach you everything you need to be off and running with Continuous Delivery.
        </p>

        <p>
          We'll start by teaching you the fundamental principles</a> of Continuous Delivery, and how it fits
          into the wider world of agile. We'll show you how integrate a set of tools to create a deployment pipeline allowing your code to flow smoothly though all the stages from development to production.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then we'll investigate how having this pipeline allows us to deploy code in much smaller batch sizes, iterating more quickly. We'll look at how automating the integration, test and release processes can change the way that a development team behaves, and the way we think about developing new features.  
        </p>

        <p>
          Read further for <a href='#learningoutcomes'>full details of our learning outcomes</a>. The course is practical and you'll experience putting the tools into action, as well as getting the theory behind them.</p>

                <p>
                  Different tool serve different purposes. We'll look at the different types, and put a selection together to form a deployment pipeline that is more than the sum of its parts.

                  You're probably working on existing projects rather than starting shiny new ones. We'll show you
                  pragmatic steps to start introducing CD techniques on an existing application.
