      <h1>In-house courses</h1>
      <p>
        Running a course in-house gives you advantages over attending a public course. You control the date and venue and, more importantly, we'll adapt the material to fit your context. We'll use real examples from your backlog for the training exercises, and we'll make sure to choose the right flavour of Cucumber or SpecFlow to suit your team's development environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        An in-house course is a great way to build the enthusiasm and expertise to make your team's transition to BDD a success.

        &ldquo;Seb's training went down very well with the team. The most useful aspect of it was that he used real stories from our work, so the team could spend the time constructively, rather than just working on something theoretical. They liked his training style, found him very knowledgable/credible and found the whole thing beneficial. It was a good balance of business and dev focus, as well, as he catered to both audiences and levels of technical ability.&rdquo;
