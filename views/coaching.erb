          <h1>Coaching</h1>
          <p>
            You've taken the course: what now? We're happy to come and see your team after the course is done. We will:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reinforce the ideas presented</li>
            <li>Significantly smooth the road to BDD adoption for your team</li>
            <li>Highlight bad habits or misunderstandings before they become embedded</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We offer a simple package which we have found to work well, consisting of a mixture of on-site visits, conference calls and unlimited email within the three months. You team will also gain access to our private alumni mailing list. If you need us for longer, you can always renew for another quarter.
          </p>
          <p>In order to ensure a basic level of understanding when we start, someone on your team needs to have been on the course: if you haven't had the opportunity yet, check out our <a href='/dates'>public dates</a> or our <a href='/in-house-courses'>in-house packages</a>.
